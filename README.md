# python-blackjack
A game called backjack that is programmed in python and is played in the terminal!

## Game Rules 
* Player starts out with 100 points.
* After the introduction the player can either put a bid in or quit the game (by inputting "0" in the bid screen).
* If the player bids, they will be in a game of blackjack; Where the player's score needs to beat the dealer to double their bid without going over 21. Two cards are drawn and shown for the player and the dealer shows one card. The player then is prompted if they want another card to increase their score or to stay wherever they are at.
* If the player loses all of their score, it will play a story and then it will exit the program.
* HOUSE RULES: House either holds on 17 OR when the bot's score is over the player's score.
